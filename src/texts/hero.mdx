  Hi.
</Text>

I'm Kat - my spirit animal is a magpie.  
I wrote my first line of code when in May 2020 decided to change my career and joined the coding Bootcamp. Now I work as a Test Engineer at 2i Testing.
I use a few great Test Automation tools: Cypress, Postman, Rest Assured, BDD Cucumber/Gherkin.  
And the best: __I keep learning!__
